# Chocolates are favourite
Complete the calculate function in the editor
so that for each day Ni (where 1 ≤ x ≤ N ≤ Y) in array arr, the number of chocolates 
Sam purchased (during days 1 through N) is printed on a new line. 
This is a function-only challenge, so input is handled for you by the locked stub code in the editor.

## Write a function `q01_chocolates` that:

- Takes an array of integers as a parameter.
- Each element i of the the array describes the ith test case as an integer, Ni (the number of days).


### Output Format
For each test case, Ti in arr, your calculate method should print the total number of chocolates Sam purchased by day Ni on a new line.

### Explanation
For eg if List=[1,2,5,8]

Test Case 0: N = 1, Sam buys 1 chocolate on day 1, giving us a total of 1 chocolate. Thus, we print 1 on a new line.

Test Case 1: N = 2, Sam buys 1 chocolate on day 1 and 0 on day 2. This gives us a total of 1 chocolate. Thus, we print 1 on a new line.

Test Case 2: N = 5, Sam buys 1 chocolate on day 1, 0 on day 2, and 5 on day 5. This gives us a total of 6 chocolates. Thus, we print 6 on a new line.

Test Case 3: N = 8, Sam buys 1 chocolate on day 1, 0 on day 2, 5 on day 5 and 0 on day 8. This gives us a total of 6 chocolates. Thus, we print 6 on a new line.
